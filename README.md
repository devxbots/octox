_A tailor-made web framework for GitHub Apps._

`octox` is a tailor-made and opinionated web framework to build GitHub Apps. It
hides the complexity of receiving, verifying, and deserializing incoming
webhooks. You only need to provide a function that runs your workflow, and
deploy the project to get started.
