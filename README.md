# ðŸ“¥ octox

_A tailor-made web framework for GitHub Apps._

`octox` is a tailor-made and opinionated web framework to build GitHub Apps. It
hides the complexity of receiving, verifying, and deserializing incoming
webhooks. You only need to provide a function that runs your workflow, and
deploy the project to get started.

## Status

We are actively developing `github-parts`. Its API and functionality are not
stable and can change at any time. During this period, we don't accept code
contributions to the project.
